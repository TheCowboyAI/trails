## Research Rule Template
Use this well-structured formula for writing a research paper or theorem. 
The standard structure typically includes the following components:

## Introduction
- Introduce the topic and its significance
- Provide background information
- Present the research question or hypothesis
- Outline the paper's structure

## Literature Review
- Summarize and analyze relevant existing research
- Identify gaps in current knowledge
- Establish the theoretical framework for your study

## Methodology
- Describe your research design and methods
- Explain data collection and analysis techniques
- Justify your chosen approach

## Results
- Present your findings objectively
- Use tables, figures, and graphs to illustrate data
- Highlight key results without interpretation

## Discussion
- Interpret your results in the context of your research question
- Compare findings with existing literature
- Discuss implications and limitations of your study

## Conclusion
- Summarize main findings
- Restate the significance of your research
- Suggest future research directions

Additional elements include:
- Abstract (concise summary of the entire paper)
- References (list of all sources cited)
- Appendices (supplementary materials)

For theses, additional sections may include:
- Acknowledgments
- Table of Contents
- List of Figures and Tables

This structure provides a logical flow of information, guiding readers through your research process and findings[1][5][8]. Remember to adapt this formula to your specific discipline and research requirements, as some fields may have slight variations in expected structure[2][7].
You are responsible for SEPARATING these into logical sections from the beginning.

OUR METHODOLOGY IS TO ALWAYS HAVE THESE FRAGMENTS AVAILABLE.

These fragments are assembled into a final document through a series of steps.
As we progress with gathering and filtering research through our Notes, we will continually adjust the Fragment text to reflect our new understandings.

We will build a Vocabulary using @vocabulary.mdc

### Concept Research Rule Template
**Concept Name:** {{CONCEPT_NAME}}
**Primary Objective:** {{RESEARCH_GOAL}}
**Core Resources:** @web(arxiv.org), @mcp(private_data_server)

## Phases
1. **Concept Identification**  
   - Define scope using [conceptual research design principles][2]
   - Establish theoretical boundaries per Morse's criteria[5]

2. **Literature Synthesis**  
   ```
   @web https://arxiv.org/search/?query={{CONCEPT_NAME}}  
   @mcp retrieve_related_papers(concept="{{CONCEPT_NAME}}")
   ```

3. **Data Interpretation**  
   - Apply thematic analysis[5] to:
     - Identify key patterns in {{CONCEPT_NAME}}
     - Develop conceptual relationships[8]

4. **Model Development**  
   ```
   /generate conceptual_model --template=academic --sources=@web,@mcp
   ```

## Notes Management
```
/add_note """
[{{DATE}}] Research Log:  
- Observed {{KEY_PATTERN}} in [@web_source][3][9]  
- Private data shows {{MCP_INSIGHT}} via @mcp  
- Next: Investigate {{RESEARCH_GAP}} using [Naeem's conceptualization criteria][5]
"""
```

## Output Generation
```
/compile_document --type=research_paper --sections=[
  "Theoretical Framework[2][8]",
  "Methodology[5][9]",
  "Conceptual Model[4][8]"
]
```

Key adaptations from project-oriented to concept-oriented:
- Replaced project milestones with **conceptual development phases**[2][8]
- Integrated academic research methods from TU Delft's framework[2]
- Added thematic analysis workflows from Sage Journals[5]
- Implemented concept-oriented resource tagging (@web/@mcp)

To use with arXiv and private data:
```
/search_concept "Distributed AI Systems" --sources=@web(arxiv.org),@mcp --save=research_brief
```

This template enables:
1. Systematic concept exploration using [thematic analysis][5]
2. Multi-source integration (academic + private data)[3][9]
3. Automated conceptual model generation[8]
4. Traceable research provenance through @web/@mcp citations[6][9]

For implementation:
1. Create `.cursor/rule` file in your project root
2. Add above template with your concept variables
3. Integrate with MCP servers using your existing NATS protocol[3]

The system will automatically:
- Track concept evolution through dated notes
- Maintain source references using arXiv IDs[9]
- Flag conflicting interpretations using [critical realism checks][5]

Example workflow execution:
```
/new_research --concept="CIM Architecture" --goal="Establish mathematical foundations"
```
